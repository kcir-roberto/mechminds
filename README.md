## Useful examples of markdown syntax

### Code

Code blocks are intended by four space or one tab. So this is a block code:

    if (linkPortCore * 23) {
        clip.cc(guid, importPrinter.webmail_password_domain.usb_printer_gif(
                spool_rpc, seoTextThunderbolt), frame_cell_ole);
        tracerouteSystem += -5;
    } else {
        queueDisk(ppp);
        gammaDesktopDns = mailDiskMemory;
        dragBalanceWired = quicktime_word_macro(illegal_hibernate_srgb, 962835 +
                5);
    }
    

### Tables

Tables in markdown can be made with use of hyphens (---) and pipes (|). Namely

    | header1 | header2 |
    | ------- | ------- |
    |  elem1  | elem2 |
    |  elem3  | elem4 |

generates following table 

| header1 | header2 |
| ------- | ------- |
|  elem1  | elem2 |
|  elem3  | elem4 |

### Images
Images can be included to the markdown page with use of the following syntax 
    
    ![alternative text](path/to/the/image.png)

For example:

![cyrobek](images/CyRobek.png "load image to markdown file")
